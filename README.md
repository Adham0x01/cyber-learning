# 🧠 cyber-learning

Welcome to my personal Cybersecurity learning repository!  
This is where I document my full journey into **Offensive Security**, **Ethical Hacking**, and general **Cybersecurity fundamentals**.

## 📍 Goals

- Build solid foundational knowledge in cybersecurity.
- Learn practical skills using hands-on labs.
- Get comfortable with tools like: Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Metasploit, etc.
- Track my learning via TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and other platforms.
- Work toward Offensive Security certifications (e.g. `OSCP` in the future).
